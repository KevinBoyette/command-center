# Eight Megs And Constantly Swapping

> It's **that** simple. Now don't you **want** to become a cult leader?

Years ago I used to be an EMACS user before fully-converting to Vim.
While Vim is powerful, configurable and all that - *Vimscript* is not the
best language to work with.

# Setup

1. Fork this repo
1. Clone to `~/.emacs.d`
2. Tweak `./package/install.el` to suit your needs (you can check out mine for inspiration)
2. run `make`
3. Edit `init.el` to load packages and add your settings.
