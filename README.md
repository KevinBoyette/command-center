# Eighty Megs And Constantly Surprising :tophat:

My emacs and shell setup. Focused on:

- Clojure
- Shell scripting
- Ops stuff (Ansible, Terraform etc)
- Occasionally;
  - Ruby
  - Javascript
  - Scheme
  - Common Lisp
  - Python

# Setup

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone to `~/.emacs.d`
3. `bash ~/.emacs.d/etc/setup && source ~/.bashrc`
3. Start Emacs, `use-package` will take over


# Details

- I use `bash`, I tried `zsh` in the past and it was not worth the effort
- you can see my old .files here: https://github.com/lukaszkorecki/DotFiles
- Emacs config is pretty light-weight, essential packages are:
  - ivy
  - projectile
  - monroe and clojure-mode
