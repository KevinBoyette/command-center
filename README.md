# emacs.d

I used to be a EMACS user before fully-converting to Vim.
While Vim is powerful, confgurable and all that - *Vimscript* is not be
best language to work with.

Thanks to fantastic [evil-mode](https://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home)
and numerous plugins I was able to recreate quite neat `vim`-like environment and
be able to use Elisp as a scripting language.

# Setup
